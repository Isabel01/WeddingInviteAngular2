                    <p>There was always something precious about Isabel. With a heart of gold, caring nature and sense of adventure. A single flash of her smile will set your world alight. I always knew that she was worth protecting, worth loving and definitely worth marrying. Never have I been more captivated by anyone. She radiates with beauty in every sense. She never fails to impress. She will always serve as a reminder of what the world could be if we just loved a bit more, laughed a bit more and cared a bit more. She is a true princess in every sense.</p>

                    <p>Hanrich Potgieter is the most handsome guy I know, he stole my heart in 2nd year of University and he has not stopped for the last 4 years. He is the reason I get up with a smile in the morning. He is very hard working and very determined, he has an addiction to technology, but I have promised to give him counseling with love for the rest of our days. He is very compassionate and has a very big heart. I admire the trust he places in God and I am privileged to have him lead our household. I can't wait to say "I do" and to become the wife of the prins I have always dreamed of.  </p>
